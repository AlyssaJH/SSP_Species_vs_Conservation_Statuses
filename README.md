# Introduction
The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) is a non-profit, independent accrediting organization representing more than 250 facilities in the United States and internationally. These facilities may participate in the AZA’s cooperatively managed Species Survival Plan (SSP) programs, which aim to manage a species’ ex situ (meaning “outside of its natural habitat” - e.g. in zoos) population. 

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), composed of both governmental and non-governmental organizations, is the global authority on the status of the natural world. The IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species is the world’s most comprehensive source of information on the global extinction risk status of animal, fungus, and plant species. Evaluated species are classified into one of eight categories: 
- Extinct (EX)
- Extinct in the Wild (EW)
- Critically Endangered (CR)
- Endangered (EN)
- Vulnerable (VU)
- Near Threatened (NT)
- Least Concern (LC)
- Data Deficient (DD)

This project aims to analyze animal species with dedicated AZA SSPs and their IUCN Red List global extinction risk statuses to determine if SSPs prioritize the world’s most vulnerable species. 

# Project Requirements 

The following features are included in this project in order to fulfull the requirements of Code:Kentucky's data analytics course: 

1. Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.).
2. Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.
3. Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.
4. Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up. 
5. Build a custom data dictionary and include it either in your README or as a separate document.
6. Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README. 

# Running the Program

To run this program, follow these steps: 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. 
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (instructions below).
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
4. You can now open the project folder in Visual Studio Code to explore the repository.
5. When you are done exploring the repository, deactivate the virtual environment. 

### Virtual Environment Instructions

1. After you have cloned the repository to your local machine, navigate to the project folder via the command line.
2. Create a virtual environment in the project folder.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Install the required packages.
5. When you are done exploring the repository, deactivate the virtual environment.

### Virtual Environment Commands

| Command | GitBash | Linux/Mac |
| ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Create | python -m venv venv | python3 -m venv venv |
| Activate | source venv/Scripts/activate | source venv/bin/activate |
| Install | pip install -r requirements.txt | pip install -r requirements.txt |
| Deactivate | deactivate | deactivate |
